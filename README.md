# chrome-dinosaur-game-remake
A remake of the chromes dinosaur game using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Created following the tutorial available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47eXVRJKdkU). 
I adapted the code to add a previous score element and a module to persist and load the score to local storage.
